# rmtadm_toolkit

The goal of this project is to provide a few simple tools and setup guides to allow simple and easy remote administration of linux computers. The idea is to set up a reasonably cheap linux laptop with a custom ssh config and several tools, and provide that laptop to a computer user who is not at all technical and probably shouldn't be in charge of administrating their own laptop. Then the user of the toolkit can provide remote support and administration for the client's machine without needing to connect to their client's home network or do any network configuration.

This is a very big WIP
